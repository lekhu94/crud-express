I have create simple CRUD App With Node JS, Express JS, and MySQl

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is a set of operations we get servers to execute (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests respectively). This is what each operation does:

Create (POST) - Make something
Read (GET)- Get something
Update (PUT) - Change something
Delete (DELETE)- Remove something
